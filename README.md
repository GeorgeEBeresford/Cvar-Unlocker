This mod is essentially a single file (cgamex86.dll) from OpenJK which allows Jedi Academy to use normally cheat-locked cvars.
If any mod relies on cgamex86.dll then it will not be able to use this mod. If this mod comes after the conflicting mod's dll then it will override it, regardless of whether the mod had intended for you to use its own .dll. Doing this may have unintended sideeffects.
